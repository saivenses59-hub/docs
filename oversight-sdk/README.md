# Oversight SDK

**The Financial Rail for AI Agents.**
Oversight is the governance, compliance, and payment infrastructure for the Agent Economy. It provides the "Central Bank" logic required to safely deploy autonomous agents with access to real capital.

## 🏛️ The Protocol
*   **Identity (KYB):** Only verified corporate agents can transact.
*   **Governance:** Enforce spend limits and "Infinite Loop" protection.
*   **Tax Engine:** Automated withholding and compliance logging.
*   **Auditability:** Every action is cryptographically recorded.
